 Calibration (black cable load cell): -4700
 Calibration (gray cable load cell):
 It is necessary to calculate a new calibration factor for each load cell. Follow the steps below to do this:
 1. Run the code.
 2. calibration_factor = average of values in the serial monitor / known weight on the load cell.
